# take-a-coding-break
What do you do to take a break from coding? I added some things I do... what about you? Please feel free to add to the list below! :smiley:

## Arts & Crafts
- I discovered rock painting in the summer of 2018. I hope to do more, especially with my kids, and possibly contribute to [The Kindness Rocks Project](https://www.thekindnessrocksproject.com/).

## Meditation
- I try to take advantage of free meditation sessions offered at my job.
- I'll sometimes use the meditation app [InsightTimer](https://www.insighttimer.com/). I like that I can meditate with that app for as briefly as 1 minute or for as long as an hour.

## Movies
- I like movies with comic book superheroes like [Ant-Man and the Wasp](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5095030/) (the first Ant-Man movie was good, but I like this second one better.)
- I can't wait for [Captain Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/movies/captain-marvel) to come out in March 2019!

## Music
- I'll sing along to [Queen](https://youtu.be/A22oy8dFjqc).

## Exercise
- Towards the end of 2018, I started taking martial arts classes 2-3 times a week with my older daughter... HI-YAH!
- I love walking. If it's nice out, I'll walk to food carts that are lined up a couple of blocks away from where I work.

## Reading for fun
- What are on my nightstand right now are [<i>Crush</i> by Svetlana Chmakova](https://svetlania.com/comics.shtml) and [<i>Invisible Emmie</i> by Terri Libenson](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/invisible-emmie) (I'm a kid at heart :wink:).

## TV
- I laugh along with my younger daughter watching [The Loud House](https://www.nick.com/shows/loud-house).
