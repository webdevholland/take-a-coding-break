# take-a-coding-break
What do you do to take a break from coding? I started with some things I do... what about you? Please feel free to add to what's below! :-)

## Arts & Crafts
- I discovered rock painting in the summer of 2018. I hope to do more, especially with my daughters, and possibly contribute to [The Kindness Rocks Project](https://www.thekindnessrocksproject.com/).

## Meditation
- I'll take a quick minute or as long as an hour using [InsightTimer](https://www.insighttimer.com/).
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) is a great introduction to guided meditations.

## Movies
- Just saw [Ant-Man and the Wasp](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5095030/)... the first Ant-Man movie was good, but I like this second one better.
- Can't wait for [Captain Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/movies/captain-marvel) to come out in March 2019!

## Music
- I'll sing along to [Queen](https://youtu.be/A22oy8dFjqc).

## Physical activity
- HI-YAH! I just started doing martial arts 3xs a week with my older daughter towards the end of 2018.

- I love walking. If it's nice out, I'll walk to food carts that are lined up a couple of blocks away from where I work.

## Reading for fun
- What's on my nightstand right now is [<i>Crush</i> by Svetlana Chmakova](https://svetlania.com/comics.shtml) (I'm a kid at heart ;-)).

## T.V.
- I laugh along with my younger daughter watching [The Loud House](https://www.nick.com/shows/loud-house).
